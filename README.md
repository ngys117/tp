## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 11 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 11 in a previous Intellij project.
   * In the same dialog, you _may have to set the Project language level_ field to the SDK default option.
2. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
3. **Verify the setup**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu.duke/Main` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Main.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   
   > Task :Main.main()  
   Successfully loaded general task data!
   Successfully loaded module data!
   No saved config data found. Default config values loaded.
